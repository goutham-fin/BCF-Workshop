# BCF-Workshop
This repository contains the materials for the mini-course on Deep learning and macro-finance taught by me at Princeton University. The mini-course is targeted at graduate students and researchers in economics and ORFE (operations research and financial engineering) who are interested in solving continuous-time general equilibrium models.
